== Planr

Planr started out as the hackathon project for Angelhack TO on June 21, 2014. The project aims to help teachers and students in communicating to improve upon lessons. 

Currently, Planr has been edited to be used for Bitmaker Labs. It will allow for students to add concepts that they do not understand from the lesson and for others to vote on the concept if they need help as well.
